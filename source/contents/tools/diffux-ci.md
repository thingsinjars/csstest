## Diffux-CI

[Diffux-CI](https://github.com/diffux/diffux_ci) checks your JavaScript
components for visual regressions. It is designed to integrate with any
continuous integration environment (such as [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/),
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), and others) and will help you catch bugs
before they end up in production. With its clear focus on components,
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) applications are perfectly suited
for Diffux-CI.
