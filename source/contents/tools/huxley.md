# Huxley

_This is an archived project and is no longer supported or updated by Facebook or Instagram._

Huxley is a test-like system for catching visual regressions in Web applications using [image diff](/techniques/image-diff.html) tests.

An key feature of this tool is that the testing framework can be run in 'record' mode to capture test scenarios automatically. This greatly simplifies the process of creating the initial test cases.
