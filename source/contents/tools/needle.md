## Needle

Needle is a tool for testing your CSS with [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) and [nose](http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/).

It checks that CSS renders correctly by taking screenshots of portions of a website and comparing them against known good screenshots. It also provides tools for testing calculated CSS values and the position of HTML elements.
