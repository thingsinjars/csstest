## Needle

Needle is a tool for testing your CSS with [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) and [nose](http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/).

It checks that CSS renders correctly using the [image diff comparison technique](/techniques/image-diff.html) of taking screenshots of portions of a website and comparing them against known good screenshots. It also provides tools for testing [calculated CSS values](/techniques/computed-style.html) and the position of HTML elements.
